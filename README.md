✨ About Me
I’m Saad Kashif, a BS Computer Science student at COMSATS University Islamabad with a strong passion for technology, coding, and digital innovation. Throughout my degree, I have built a solid foundation in programming with Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, while also exploring tools such as Canva, WordPress, and Raptor Flowcharts to strengthen my problem‑solving and creative skills.

Beyond academics, I actively engage with the crypto and trading space, where I’ve worked as a Community Manager and Twitter Manager for multiple projects, including GainzAlgo, $SHEP, Greenbit, CGAR, and Mowa. These roles allowed me to combine my technical knowledge with marketing, community growth, and content creation, giving me practical experience in leadership, communication, and teamwork.

I’m deeply passionate about blockchain, fintech, and emerging technologies, and I enjoy building projects that bridge my computer science knowledge with real‑world applications. I’m currently seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a developer and innovator, while continuing to explore the intersection of technology and digital communities.
